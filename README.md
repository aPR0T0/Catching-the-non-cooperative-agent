## Catching the non-cooperative agent

This project is built upon the current implementation of the [Teaming Heterogeneous Ground and Micro-Aerial Robots for Following
of Non-Cooperative Agents](https://raaslab.org/icra2023-hmrs/assets/contributed_papers/Ori_A_Miller_et_al.pdf)

Targets:
- [ ] Improving the prediction usiing kalman predictor
- [ ] Using Fuel contraints to gain the optimal path that a UAV and UGV should follow
- [ ] It is not necessary that UAV and UGV should follow same number of points they should be nearly independent
